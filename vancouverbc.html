	<p class="bcdescription"> One of my friends and I decided to take a road trip up to Vancouver, B.C., during spring break. I went on a trip with my family to B.C. about ten years ago, so I don't have that many memories of the city. I was excited to go to Canada because this would be my first time in another country without my parents. With that being said, I was ready for the responsibility, because I have traveled to many different countries before. I knew that I was prepared to do it just with another friend with me. Even though we were only there for a few days, I made sure to fill our days up with as much adventure as possible. The days were full of crossing over suspension bridges, 	seeing waterfalls, mountains, and the beautiful city of Vancouver. </p>

 	<p class="bodytext">Brandywine Falls Provincial Park is just off of the beautiful Sea to Sky Highway (Highway 99) between Garibaldi and Whistler, B.C. It is just a short hike from the parking lot, and you can see the 230 foot falls, and when the light hits just right, a rainbow reflecting off the water too! </p>

	<p class="bodytext">The Sky Pilot Suspension Bridge is located at the top of the Sea to Sky Gondola in Squamish, B.C. While riding the gondola to the top of the viewpoint, you can look out at the Howe sound and other parts up B.C. on a clear day. Once you reach the top, you can go across this suspension bridge to get even more views of the beautiful British Columbia. </p>
