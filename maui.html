<h2> Maui </h2>
<h3> August 15th - 21st, 2018 </h3>

<body class="mauipage" class="grid-container">
<p> My family's trip to Maui would be my 5th time to the Hawaiian Islands, but my first time to this specific island. Everyone that I know who has been to Maui has said that it is their favorite island, so my family and I had to check it out for ourselves. My Mom, little sister, and I decided to book the vacation and spend a relaxing time together. We spent most of our days tanning on the sandy beaches or by the pool, but we made sure to fit in some more adventurous activities during our stay. Those would include seeing the island from 10,000 feet at the Haleakalā volcano and snorkeling around the Molokini crater. </p>

Pictured above is a beautiful Hawaiian sunset. There's nothing better than watching the sun go down on a tropical island. I firmly believe that the best sunsets I've ever witnessed are at the Hawaiian islands. So make sure you spend at least one evening during your time there sitting back and taking in the beauty of the sun hitting the horizon. </p>

Haleakalā national park is home to the highest peak on the island of Maui. At 10,023 feet, you can see parts of the beautiful island while also being above the clouds. Being on top of the volcano makes you feel as if you are on another plant. It is a must-do while visiting Maui. </p>

 The Molokini Crater is a crescent-shaped, partially submerged volcanic crater. The crater houses a lush reef with excellent visibility as deep as 150 feet. The reef is home to about 250 species of fish, and a lot of them are indigenous to that area. With that in mind, it's a popular tourist destination for scuba diving, snuba, and snorkeling. </p>
