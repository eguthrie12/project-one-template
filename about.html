		<p>Emily Guthrie is currently a junior in the graphic design program at Portland State University. Born and raised in Portland, Oregon, she has always been drawn to the surrounding nature. Seven years ago, she was given her first camera by her grandfather, who taught her the basics of photography. Since then, she continues to improve her photography skills and tries to get out to take photos as much as she can. Emily loves to travel and experience new cultures and landscapes and captures it with her cameras. </p>
