	<p class="chicagodescription"> I packed my suitcase full of warm layers and a puffy jacket and headed to the Portland Aiport in the early hours of a winter morning. I was going to be visiting my cousin, the same age as me, who attends Loyola University Chicago. It was going to be my first time in Chicago, let alone the midwest. With that being said, I was in for a freezing time because I decided to go in the middle of winter. It snowed the few days I was there, and it was very cool to see snow on the Bean. Part of the river had frozen chunks of ice on it, and some of my photos I took made it look as if I was in the arctic. One of the days that I was there, I had to myself because of my cousin and work, so it was my first time exploring a city by myself. It felt liberating deciding where to walk to next and see so many cool things. I can't wait to go back to Chicago, maybe during a warmer season! </p>
